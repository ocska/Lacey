                            <p class="mbr-text align-right mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Military history has been my passion since childhood.  In fact, the first story I remember reading, after getting past “See Jane run. Run Jane Run” was about the Spartans at Thermopylae.  Eventually, that interest translated into a military career, where I spent a dozen years as an active duty infantry officer and finally retired out of the Army Reserves.
<br><br>After active duty I spent a number of years in the business wilderness, before my office on the 82nd floor of Tower Two collapsed on 9-11.  Looking back on events after that everything seems to have taken place at whirlwind pace, as I gave up on trying to be a Wall Street capitalist and launched a career as a writer and historian.  
<br>My first stop was the newspapers, and the New York Post and New York Sun were kind enough to offer me my own column.  That went on for about a year, where I learned a lot about the difficulties of plugging-out a new and interesting 800-words every week… for two different papers.  
<br><br>But, as the march toward war with Iraq was heating up, I wedeled my way into a job with Time Magazine as an embedded journalist.  I embedded with the 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne division, in which, as luck would have it, I had commanded a company a dozen-years before.  If any of you are interested in my final reflections on the early weeks of the war in Iraq go here. 
<br>Upon returning to Iraq, I set out to write a book about the invasion – Takedown.  This led me to the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and a new job as a think-tank analyst for the next six years.  The work was fascinating, and IDA supported my finally getting my PhD in history.
<br>My PhD was all of eight-days old when the Marine Corps War College risked hiring me.  That seems to have worked out for both of us, and I am rapidly closing in on a decade at this great institution.  I absolutely love teaching strategy and military history to thirty new students a year, and hugely appreciate the time the school allows me to research and write.
<br>
<br>On a more personal level, I am married to a wonderful woman (Sharon), who is an excellent historian in her own right.  I have two great kids – adults now – from a first marriage (Allison and James), along with a parcel of step-children (Edward, Anastasia, Adam, and Ethan).  There is also a dog, and Sharon informs me that we will soon have chickens. &nbsp;<br></p>
