                                <p class="block-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Military history has been my passion since childhood. In fact, the first story I remember reading, after getting past “See Jane run. Run Jane run”, was about the Spartans at Thermopylae. Eventually that interest translated into a military career as an infantry officer with twenty-five years’ service in the Army’s active and reserve forces.
<br>
<br>After active duty I spent a number of years in the business wilderness, before my office on the 82nd floor of Tower Two collapsed on 9-11. Looking back on events after that everything seems to have taken place at whirlwind pace, as I gave up on trying to be a Wall Street capitalist and launched a career as a writer and historian. 
<br>
<br>My first stop was the newspapers, and the New York Post and New York Sun were kind enough to offer me my own column. That went one for about a year, where I learned a lot about the difficulties of plugging-out a new and interesting 800-words every week… for two different papers. 
<br>
<br>But, as the march toward war with Iraq was heating up, I wheedled my way into a job with Time Magazine as an embedded journalist. I embedded with the 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne division, in which, as luck would have it, I had commanded a company a dozen-years before. If any of you are interested in my final reflections on the early weeks of the war in Iraq go <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2003/05/men-who-won-war-jim-lacey/">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>Upon returning to Iraq, I set out to write a book about the invasion –<em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Takedown-Infantry-Divisions-Twenty-One-Assault-ebook/dp/B00DTF02JC/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530812855&sr=1-11">Takedown</a></em>. This led me to the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and a new job as a think-tank analyst for the next six years. The work was fascinating, and IDA supported my finally getting my PhD in history.
<br>
<br>My PhD was all of eight-days old when the Marine Corps War College risked hiring me. That seems to have worked out for both of us, and I am rapidly closing in on a decade at this great institution. I absolutely love teaching strategy and military history to thirty new students a year, and hugely appreciate the time the school allows me to research and write.
<br>
<br>On a more personal level, I am married to a wonderful woman (Sharon), who is an excellent historian in her own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Blitzkrieg-World-War-Central/dp/1574415255/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531420747&sr=1-1-fkmr1&keywords=pacific+blitzkreig+lacey">right</a>. I have two great kids – adults now – from a first marriage (Allison and James), along with a passel of step-children (Edmund, Anastasia, Adam, and Ethan). There is also a dog and Sharon informs me that we will soon have chickens.&nbsp;</p>
